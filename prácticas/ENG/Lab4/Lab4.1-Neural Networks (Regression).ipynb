    "## **1. Introduction**  \n",
    "In previous practices, we learned how to solve classification and regression problems using traditional machine learning methods or models. In this practice, we will see how to solve these types of problems using **Neural Networks**, which are among the most commonly used methods today.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These networks form the foundation of *Deep Learning* and have the capability of being highly versatile as they are composed of multiple neurons organized into layers. These neurons are also called *perceptrons*, which is why neural networks are also known as **Multilayer Perceptrons**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with other models, `scikit-learn` provides a couple of classes that facilitate the use of these networks:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **MLPRegressor:** A multilayer perceptron designed to solve regression problems.  \n",
    "* **MLPClassifier:** A multilayer perceptron designed to solve classification problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this type of model, we will not use these predefined classes since we are interested in understanding their architecture and internal functioning. For this reason, we will use a new library, [`tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/), which is one of the most widely used in Python for deep learning tasks, along with [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**  \n",
    "In this practice, you will learn to:  \n",
    "* Create and train Neural Networks.  \n",
    "* Optimize their hyperparameters.  \n",
    "* Add nonlinear activation functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by installing the library in our environment."

    "##### **Adding Non-Linearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make some modifications and create a different, slightly more complex model to see if we can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall, not all problems have a linear solution. A basic neural network like ours is limited to performing linear combinations of numbers (sums and multiplications), meaning it transforms the input into the output using the formula $y = Wx + b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce non-linearity, we need to incorporate **non-linear activation functions**. These functions are applied to the output of each layer, allowing the network to learn more complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Some common activation functions include `ReLU`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh`. By adding these functions, the network can approximate non-linear functions and solve more challenging problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <div style=\"border-radius:5px; padding:10px; background:white; max-width:900px\">\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current model has only one layer, the output layer. If we were to apply any of these functions to this layer, not only would we fail to introduce non-linearity, but we would also significantly restrict the range of values the model can predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we only add a `sigmoid` function to the final layer, we would have a linear model whose output will **always** be limited to the range between 0 and 1. This is not ideal for our regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve non-linearity and avoid this limitation—while allowing the model to predict in a range of values between $(-\\infty , \\infty)$—we will add a hidden (or intermediate) layer and apply activation in this layer. This way, the final layer can generate outputs without the restrictions imposed by the activation function while still achieving non-linearity."
